# RockPaperScissors_Game

It's was a challenge from frontendmentor.io. <br>
I had fun doing it, although it was really challenging at various points, yet it was great when I found the solutions. <br>
I think it could use some code refactoring.<br>
On the JavaScript side, I used JQUERY, and on the CSS side I helped myself with SASS. <br><br>
